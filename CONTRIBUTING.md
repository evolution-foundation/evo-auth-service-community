## Database migrations — version parity (EVO-2090)

This service shares a single `schema_migrations` table with
`evo-ai-crm-community` (both apps point at the same database). If the two ever
create a migration with the same 14-digit version, Rails records it once and
**skips** the other app's migration forever → missing DDL → boot crash.

To make collisions impossible by construction, each app owns a **disjoint slice
of the version space by parity**:

- **auth (this repo): ODD versions** — timestamps ending in `1/3/5/7/9`
- **CRM: EVEN versions** — timestamps ending in `0/2/4/6/8`

When you generate a migration, bump the timestamp by 1 second if needed so its
version is **odd**. Enforced by `spec/migration_version_parity_spec.rb`
(migrations created before the convention are grandfathered by a cutoff date).
